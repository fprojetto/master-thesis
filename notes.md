## Ideas for the product e/o research

- Instead (in addition to) of conducting interviews with users, make a customizable app with adaptable strategies. PSD model principles used might vary over time depending on their actual and perceived effectiveness or user's preference.

- Make evident the science that our intervention is based on.

- I'd like to write a handful of blogposts to share my journey in Persuasive Technology.

- Use IoT devices to improve sleep. IoT Persuasion?
    - check temperature and adjust heating?
    - check light conditions and advice user?
    - wakeup using light instead of alarm?

- TTM theory does not explicitily have a place for people that have failed in reaching the "termination" stage. Also, it's weird to call it termination when it's actually a starting point for a new life where you have finally take advantage of the newly formed behaviour naturally (ie. without the need for further interventions).

- Find out the domino habit that will create a powerful ripple effect of change.
- Create a mechanism to help users to get back to build healthy habits after they have had a break for any reasons.
- Create a routine for the user to stick to the newly created habit in the long term.
- Teach the user new skills and knowledge that empower them towards their health related goals.
- We anticipate further growth and widespread adop-tion of ML-driven adaptive systems in health and wellnessdomains to promote tailored, contextual, and real-time inter-ventions/support and motivate better adherence and continu-ous user engagement.
- Use gamification.
- Use machine learning to personalise and tailor persuasive technique.
- Empower users with knowledge according to social theory of self-determination.

## Knowledge
- How to write a thesis: https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/thesis-structure

- Question: what is the relationship between "thinking fast and slow" and the PSD model? Is there a model for behaviour change support systems based on kahneman's theory?
  - answer: The 2 systems model from the book does not seem to be taken into consideration in any tech system design model.
  - answer: it's a theory not a framework/model.

Important contributions in understanding human behaviour, ie. behavioural theories:

1. [Thinking, fast and slow (dual systems theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) 
2. [Nudge Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory)
3. [Theories for public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health))

   3.1 [behavior change model course](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/SB/BehavioralChangeTheories/BehavioralChangeTheories-TOC.html)
4. [Behavioural change theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_change_theories)

There are many behavioural theories. How do I pick one? Do I need to pick one? Maybe, it's enough to pick a design model that is based on a set of theories. So knowing the theories will guide me in choosing the design model to create a technological system that supports behaviour change. In particular, a system that assists people interested in living a happier life in achieving their vision. 

- I have read a paper that provides users different interventions based on their personality.
- I tried to understand how different theories and models for behaviour change fit together.
- Attitude vs Behaviour.

A central feature of analyzing the intent is to consider the change type, in particular whether the persuasion aims at attitude and/or behavior change. One-time behavior change may be achieved more easily, whereas permanent behavior change is much more difficult. An attitude change that directs behavior may be the most difficult to achieve. Attitudes can vary in many ways. They may be based on emotions, beliefs, or past experiences and behaviors, and they may be internally consistent or ambivalent [Petty and Wegener 1998]. Attitude change means that a person’s evaluation is modified from one value to another. In our view, attitudes do not always predict or determine behavior. It is also possible to affect users’ behavior with a persuasive system even if their attitudes toward the behavior are not favorable. This is supported by the theory of cognitive consistency. This theory suggests that one can often proceed more efficiently from behavior to attitudes [McGuire 1973]. If the behavior changes first, for example by legal constraints, it may be expected that the attitude change will follow.

- Information Foraging theory  [36].

- The zone of proximal development (ZPD) is the level to which a person can advance with the help of others who are already on a slightly more advanced level [11]. This has two implications: 1) support from others is essential to the learning process, and 2) the step to the next level should be small enough to be within reach.

## Questions
1. What's our thesis about?
2. What do we want to build?
We want to build a wellness mobile application that helps the user in improving its quality of life.
   - Tracking.
There are millions of apps that track and visualise health related statistics. That's not interesting for us. It's more something that needs to be done. But it won't be our differentiator, ie. a competitive advantage.

Our competitive advange/innovation could be:
   - Adaptive interventions.
   - Coaching, eg. pathways, mix chatbot and human.
   - Support Learning, eg. through serious gaming.
   - Habit formation.

3. How do we measure success/results?

- Think about which topics and theories you are interested in and what you would like to know more about. Is there some question you feel the body of knowledge in your field does not answer adequately? 

1. Healthy living and sustainable behaviours are two application domains I am interested in. How can persuasive technologies influence humans and solve societal and personal problems?

2. Design, development and evaluation of technologies.

## Attempt to find a gap in the literature

**Research gap #1:**  These findings suggest that more interactive, customizable tools and applications may indeed enhance individuals’ self-determination to use these online resources for preventive health efforts.
  - Intrinsically motivated individuals are more successful in these programs than those whose behaviors are controlled by external factors. The key challenge therefore is to devise technologies for building self-determination among individuals without the need for repeated and expensive interventions. 
  - Self-determination theory proposes that competence, autonomy and relatedness are essential for one to be intrinsically motivated toward a goal.

## Exercise: use PSD model to design an application
### The Intent

1. Persuader. Where does the intention come from?

Semi-autogenous system: users are provided by the system (endogenous) with a list of areas s/he can work on, and the users pick (autogenous) what they want to start working on. The system might suggest the domino habit, but the user can ignore the suggestion.

2. Change Type. Change Behaviour, tracking a possible change in attitude?

### The Event

1. Use context. What's the use context? High-stress environment? At the park? At work?

2. User context. Adapt to personality type?

3. Technology context. Mobile app and some fitness tracker.

### The Strategy

1. Message.

Persuasion relies primarily on symbolic strategies that trigger the emotions, whereas conviction relies on strategies rooted in logical proof and appeals to persuadees’ reason and intelligence.

2. Route.

   a. Direct route. Persuade the user by appealing to reason and intelligence.

   b. Indirect route. When an individual sees relevant cues, heuristics are triggered.

Simple idea: compare simple steps count to simulation. How much does it matter? eg. steps count vs camino de santiago.
